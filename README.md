> I experienced some strange behavior with my DPS meter where reloading while the meter was showing and pfUI set to not display meters by default caused the damage meter window to appear undocked on login  

### Configuration  
All settings are found in pfUI:
- Open pfUI configuration `/pfui`
- Navigate to `Thirdparty` â†’ `Embed Plus`

### Requirements  
- [pfUI](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI)
